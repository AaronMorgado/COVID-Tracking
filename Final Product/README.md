## Description

This project is a mobile app that calculates how close the user is to each of their friends using an ego network that calculates friendship levels. The ego network is able to calculate these friendship levels using uploaded Instagram and Snapchat data that must be uploaded to the userâ€™s device. This information is then able to be used to track COVID-19 spread along with who you are most at risk of spreading COVID-19 to or getting COVID-19 from. This app can also be used by researchers who are interested in experimenting with and learning more about Ego Networks.

#### Technologies:

- Dart
- Flutter
- Python

## How To Install and Run

To be able to run this application download this GitHub repository and then then run covid_app/covid_app/main.dart. To do this you must have Flutter and Dart installed and set up for your machine along with a way to run the app. Running the app can be done by connecting a mobile device or by using an emulator. We recommend using an emulator alongside either VS Code, Android Studio, or Xcode depending on your preference and operating system.

In the future we would like to add this app to the appstore to make the process of aquiring the app easier.
